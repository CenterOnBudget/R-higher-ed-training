# R-higher-ed-training

[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## Overview

R training based on analyzing trends in state higher education funding using data from [SHEEO](https://shef.sheeo.org/data-downloads/) and [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/home.htm). Concepts covered include simple base R syntax and [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse) tools for data import, cleaning, analysis, and export.

## Resources

This training draws on the work of [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), [Garret Grolemund](https://rstudio.com/speakers/garrett-grolemund/), and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), whose educational resources have been invaluable to the R community. For more on the concepts covered in this training, check out:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund
- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham

In addition to the above resources, this training also draws on [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/#) by Greg Wilson. In particular, [these rules](http://teachtogether.tech/#the-rules) are used as guiding principles.
