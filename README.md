## Overview

Intro to R based on analyzing trends in state higher education funding using data from [SHEEO](https://shef.sheeo.org/data-downloads/) and [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/home.htm). Topics covered include basic R concepts and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) tools for data import, cleaning, analysis, and export.

## Resources
